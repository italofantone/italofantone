## Technical Lead / Senior Software Engineer

I work as a Technical Lead / Senior Software Engineer with a strong focus on architecture, system design, and product-driven engineering.

My work emphasizes deliberate technical decisions, clear trade-offs, and long-term sustainability over short-term delivery. I care less about frameworks and more about why a system is built a certain way and how it evolves over time.

### What you’ll find here

- Reference implementations focused on architectural clarity
- Backend and system design projects used to explore real-world trade-offs
- Code intended for review and technical discussion, not tutorials

### How to read these projects

Each repository aims to document:
- the problem context and constraints
- key architectural and technical decisions
- trade-offs and alternatives considered
- product and maintainability implications

Laravel, PHP, and other tools appear here as implementation details, not as the center of the discussion.
