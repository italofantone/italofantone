# 👋 Italo Morales Fantone

## Technical Lead / Senior Software Engineer

I work with a strong focus on architecture, system design, and product-driven engineering.

My work emphasizes deliberate technical decisions, clear trade-offs, and long-term sustainability over short-term delivery. I care less about frameworks and more about why a system is built a certain way and how it evolves over time.

### What you’ll find here

- Reference implementations focused on architectural clarity.
- Backend and system design projects used to explore real-world trade-offs.
- Code intended for review and technical discussion, not tutorials.

### How to read these projects

Each repository aims to document:
- The problem context and constraints.
- Key architectural and technical decisions.
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered.
- Product and maintainability implications.

Laravel, PHP, and other tools appear here as implementation details, not as the center of the discussion.
